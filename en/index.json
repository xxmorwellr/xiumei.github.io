[{"content":"This is my first post, and I am happy to start my blogging journey from here.\nDuring my bachelor\u0026rsquo;s study in Statistics, I begin to analyze data with renowned Iris dataset, which has plenty of features to be classified, summarized and visualized. As a polysemy, \u0026ldquo;iris\u0026rdquo; represents both iris flowers(\u0026ldquo;È∏¢Â∞æ\u0026rdquo;) and the colored part of the eye(\u0026ldquo;ËôπËÜú\u0026rdquo;): Van Gogh gazed at the flowers.\nI think life is just like the end of April: Although one missed the peach blooms, it is still beautiful now. The roses, poppies, and azaleas are all in bloom. So I want to seize the present day and say to all the people who passed by my life: Welcome to my garden.\nIn my childhood, blogging was a popular method for recording life. Bulaoge(‰∏çËÄÅÊ≠å), whose Chinese pronunciation resembles \u0026ldquo;blog\u0026rdquo; in English, was an outstanding blogging platform in China at that time. However, as time passed, traditional blogging was gradually replaced by shorter forms of expression such as microblogs (like Weibo and Twitter) and vlogs. With no surprise, Bulaoge disappeared along with the shift in trends.\nNow, I wish to adopt the Chinese meaning \u0026ldquo;timeless song\u0026rdquo; from Bulaoge to name my blog. This not only serves as a tribute to the golden years of the past but also serves as a reminder to cherish each moment and document my life\u0026rsquo;s journey.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/posts/whytimelesssong/","summary":"This is my first post, and I am happy to start my blogging journey from here.

It has been used by a lot of literary creators to write unexpected but reasonable articles. Journey under the midnight sun, considered as the peak work of the famous Japanese detective novelist Keigo Higashino, is a modern variant of the the method of grass snake and gray line. Its enduring artistic charm shows that this technique is not out of date. Through text mining and social network analysis, this paper restores the novel\u0026rsquo;s time axis, explores the characters\u0026rsquo; appearance frequency and sequence, and draws social network maps, which makes the role factions clear at a glance and verifies the strong connection between the two main characters. The study shows that text mining and social network analysis still have more values to be exploited in exploring complex literary works. This paper fills in the current research gap in this field, predicting that after introducing more modern statistical techniques, literary research will break through the restrictions of qualitative analysis and open up a new paradigm for studying literary works.\nKey words: The method of grass snake and gray line¬†Journey under the midnightsun¬†text mining¬†social network analysis¬†Two-mode network analysis\nFULL TEXT\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/projects/bachelor_thesis/","summary":"Abstract The method of grass snake and gray line(\u0026ldquo;ËçâËõáÁÅ∞Á∫øÊ≥ï\u0026rdquo;) is a narrative technique originating from Chinese classical novels, which connects events, appearing successive characters, forming readers‚Äôexpectation horizons, and","title":"Text Mining and Social Network Analysis Based on Novel"},{"content":" 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 class Me: def __init__(self): self.name = \u0026#34;Xiumei Xue\u0026#34; self.born_year = 1998 self.pronouns = \u0026#34;She/Her\u0026#34; self.MBTI = \u0026#34;INFJ\u0026#34; self.hometown = \u0026#34;Yancheng, Jiangsu, CN\u0026#34; self.curr_location = \u0026#34;Gothenburg, V√§stra G√∂taland, SE\u0026#34; 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 CREATE TABLE Skill ( -- omit Table Person sharing PRIMARY KEY (avoid duplicated info above) id INT PRIMARY KEY, -- MD5 encoded languages VARCHAR(255), frameworks VARCHAR(255), possessed_skills VARCHAR(255), developing_skills VARCHAR(255) ); INSERT INTO Skill (id, languages, frameworks, possessed_skills, developed_skills) VALUES (\u0026#39;4aa37d1f4838986bc259354709bf2f5a\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;R,SQL,Python,JavaScript\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;PyTorch,vue.js,Xstate\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Data Analysis, Product Development, Project Management\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;Natural Language Processing, Prompt Engineering, Full-Stack Engineering\u0026#39;); ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/about/","summary":"1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 class Me: def __init__(self): self.name = \u0026#34;Xiumei Xue\u0026#34; self.born_year = 1998 self.pronouns = \u0026#34;She/Her\u0026#34; self.MBTI = \u0026#34;INFJ\u0026#34; self.hometown = \u0026#34;Yancheng, Jiangsu, CN\u0026#34; self.curr_location = \u0026#34;Gothenburg, V√§stra G√∂taland, SE\u0026#34; 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 CREATE TABLE Skill ( -- omit Table Person sharing PRIMARY KEY (avoid duplicated info above) id INT PRIMARY KEY, -- MD5 encoded languages VARCHAR(255), frameworks VARCHAR(255), possessed_skills VARCHAR(255), developing_skills VARCHAR(255) ); INSERT INTO Skill (id, languages, frameworks, possessed_skills, developed_skills) VALUES (\u0026#39;4aa37d1f4838986bc259354709bf2f5a\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;R,SQL,Python,JavaScript\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;PyTorch,vue.","title":"About Meüëã"},{"content":"As an enrolled postgraduate in Language Technology, I am really interested in so-called language.

To me, the world is a vast tapestry woven from words, grammar, sounds, and their endless combinations, each giving rise to different genres and expressions.\nIn the process of growing up, I began to contact English as my first foreign language. Later, I learned French, Russian, and Finnish out of interest. Now Swedish has been my most recent addition. Through this linguistic odyssey, I\u0026rsquo;ve come to appreciate the nuances and connections between different language systems.\nWith the development of the times, language is given endless vitality. Especially during the pandemic, the Internet has accelerated the formation of an extreme online language system. It is easy to slip into the \u0026ldquo;dualism\u0026rdquo; in the constantly reversed lies and truth without an eye on emerging concepts, making the relationships between people more torn.\nMy previous experiences also supported my interests in language. My undergraduate thesis took the novel Journey under the Midnight Sun by Japanese writer Keigo Higashino as the research object. Through text mining and social network analysis, the network diagram is drawn to make the role faction clear at a glance and verify the strong connection between the two protagonists. After graduation, I gained a lot of data analysis experience in multiple fields, including automobile, online finance, and content marketing, where online text is a critical analysis object, like comments and \u0026ldquo;bullet screens\u0026rdquo;. It was during this time that I became intrigued by the concept of \u0026ldquo;Online Discourse\u0026rdquo;, recognizing its pivotal role in shaping strategic decisions. Meanwhile, I realized my need for deeper professional knowledge in the latest language technology to connect to the exciting Large Language Model era.\nIn a sense, language shapes everything in human society, and I want to know more about it ‚Äî‚Äî that is why I am here.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/en/posts/whylanguage/","summary":"As an enrolled postgraduate in Language Technology, I am really interested in so-called language.
